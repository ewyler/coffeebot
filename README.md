# ct-catbot
Catbot slackbot

# Installation

```
$ npm install
```

# Testing

The easiest way to test this is to setup your own Slack account, configure the bot (per Slack's docs),
and update the API key in the source (see `SLACK_TOKEN` near the top) with the necessary one
for your Slack account. You can then run it locally via `npm run start`.

# Deployment

TBD, this is on Eric's Heroku account but will be hosted in a more proper location in the future.
