# ct-catbot
Catbot bot for Slack

# Installation

```
$ npm install
```

# Running

The easiest way to test this is to:
1. Setup your own Slack account
1. Configure the bot (per Slack's docs) on that Slack account
1. Set the `SLACK_TOKEN` environment variable to your slack token
1. `npm run start`

TBD add heroku stuff.

# Deployment

TBD, this is on Eric's Heroku account but will be hosted in a more proper location in the future.
